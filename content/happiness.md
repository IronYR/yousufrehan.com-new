Happiness. The attainment of which is so simple, but which eludes most. After reading this post and implementing it, you may belong to the "chosen few".

Ibn-Qayyim, while advising his friend, wrote about the secret to attaining happiness. According to him, it's as simple as following 6 easy steps.

The steps require you to do some reflection on what constitutes happiness and what doesn't for you. As such you have to set aside some time to do this exercise. 

### 1. To know that which is suitable and brings forth benefits through which you attain pleasure, comfort, and happiness.
First, write down what things make you happy and what don't. I encourage you to search deep inside to find your sources of happiness, and to inspect whether you agree with them or are they something someone has imposed on you. 

### 2. To know the path leading to it
If the thing which brings happiness to you is something that you have already experienced, then this step will be relatively easy. 

If the thing has not been experienced, this step will be a bit challenging. I advise you to reverse engineer the path to it. 

### 3. Embarking upon the path
Now that you have prepared a clear path for things that please you, it's time for the hard part. Executing. If you are a sensible individual and have prepared a realistic path to attain the things which bring happiness, then you will promptly start on the path to happiness. Red alert.

It's important to note that you have to learn to love the process of attaining happiness and find contentment in it. Otherwise, you might feel after executing on the path that you are not happy.

Also, just to be clear, you should not overburden yourself at the start. Start by trying to attain one thing from your list of things that cause pleasure.

You mustn't overtax yourself. This is a lifelong process. And as Arnold Bennett said, 
>A failure at the commencement may easily kill outright the newborn impulse towards a complete vitality, and therefore every precaution should be observed to avoid it. The impulse must not be over-taxed. Let the pace of the first lap be even absurdly slow, but let it be as regular as possible.

### 4. To know that which causes harm and consequently disturbs your life
This step will require mostly the things you did in the first step, but with the aim of finding things that cause you to harm and bring about unhappiness. 

### 5. To know the path leading to it.

If the thing that brings you unhappiness has already been experienced, then you will know the steps which brought it about.

If it has not been experienced, then you should either try to reverse engineer it, or you should look for other people who experienced the thing and find out their path to it. 

### 6. To avoid such a path
Is one who purposefully chooses things that make him unhappy worthy to be called a sensible and rational individual? I leave that for you to decide.

Though these seem to be 6 easy steps, they will require patience and perseverance to get right. 

### Big Takeaways
- Find out what things bring happiness and what don't.
- Find out the steps that lead to these things.
- Follow the steps of those things that please you and avoid the steps of those things that don't.
