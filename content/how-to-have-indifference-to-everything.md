The key to being indifferent is to view everything with the lens of an outsider who has no stake in what's happening to you. See the things in an objective point of view and pass judgement to other.

Being indifferent is the only think that will offer you freedom from anxiety and stress and worrying about things of no consequence.

Remember the only thing worrying about is yourself and where you are headed. And not the opinion of someone you haven't even see since birth.

Nada.
